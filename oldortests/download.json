With this being said, a fair disclaimer that I am not the one who created this theory and analysis in this video, but more like a translation and summary of the original analysis video &lt;a href=\"https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LC4y187Cc\"&gt;Bilibili link here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Spoiler Alert going forward]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, let’s get familiar with some terms I’m going to use for the rest of this article.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a total of 3 versions of the world, 3 versions of Ichigyou Ruri (girl), and 3 versions of Katagaki Naomi (guy), including when they are in the coma state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 16 year old simulated Naomi, we will call him Beta Naomi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/32u7c14hbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c132578dbe578c88f24bfa3ac32d74d5ddf9cf67\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/32u7c14hbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c132578dbe578c88f24bfa3ac32d74d5ddf9cf67&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 16 year old simulated Ruri, we will call her Beta Ruri.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/d65zj7shbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0b7fdb995be5cf177df9ea77f6c5db1d3a19a98b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/d65zj7shbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0b7fdb995be5cf177df9ea77f6c5db1d3a19a98b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the world they are originally living in, we will call it Beta world. Beta world is where the first half of the movie took place, and this is a simulated world (unreal).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, we have the 26 year old simulated Naomi, we will call him Alpha Naomi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hg620wjjbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=55baf11ed7a6436f7754e969f03a2bdb42b6aa70\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/hg620wjjbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=55baf11ed7a6436f7754e969f03a2bdb42b6aa70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 26 year old simulated Ruri (coma), we will call her Alpha Ruri.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gldhq5bkbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8c47a41cacb98acfd1d5105e8b9dbf2baf78d464\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/gldhq5bkbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8c47a41cacb98acfd1d5105e8b9dbf2baf78d464&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the world they are living in, we will call it Alpha world. Alpha world is where the second half of the movie took place, and this is also a simulated world (unreal).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the 26 year old Naomi (coma)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y08mv56lbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8a0a58cfe21d8c0030345c3e8de8e4d5e49058b7\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/y08mv56lbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8a0a58cfe21d8c0030345c3e8de8e4d5e49058b7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And 26 year old Ruri in the real world&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qix0ypllbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b02fe9e74ff089318a86040ba3939edfe40b2319\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/qix0ypllbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b02fe9e74ff089318a86040ba3939edfe40b2319&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will just call them Real Naomi and Real Ruri, and the world they live in we will call it the reality. Reality is where the final scene took place right before the credit scene. You can tell the final scene is the reality because it was shown in 2D animation, while the entire movie was shown in 3D animation instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s begin with laying out the key questions that everyone have for the ending:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How did Real Naomi fall into a coma? What happened in reality?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How did Real Naomi get 100% synchronization with his real body at the end? What exact event triggered this to happen?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One main theory I read online explains the ending like this (theory from Reddit):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real Ruri was struck by lightning, and Real Naomi spent his next 10 years climb up to become ALLTALE administrator. He entered Beta world, convince Beta Naomi to save Beta Ruri from the accident, and then sync Beta Ruri’s mind into Real Ruri’s body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the ALLTALE was not perfect, Real Naomi somehow failed to “log out” himself. He went into Alpha world instead, thinking that he has been back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, in this theory Alpha Naomi never existed. The Naomi in Alpha world was the real version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now at the same time, Real Ruri woke up from coma in reality, but real Naomi is now in coma. She figured out what happened to Real Naomi, then she dedicated herself in the next 10 years doing the same thing as Real Naomi did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ALLTALE improved over time, so by the time when she dived in as a crow avatar saving Real Naomi, she was able to freely logout at this time. Then, Real Ruri (crow) brought Beta Naomi into the Alpha world, assisting him to save Beta Ruri. But at the same time, she was also secretly trying to salvage Real Naomi’s mind in order to bring him back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, Real Naomi was able to wake up and Real Ruri logged out from ALLTALE. And now, this was in year 2047 on the moon base, so Ruri and Naomi were both 36 years old in reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While this theory does make sense in chronological order, I feel something is…...off&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We learned in the movie that the concept of syncing a person’s quantum mind and physical body is by having the mind’s state as close to the accident as possible. In another words, the quantum mind must have the same mentality and emotion as the real person right before they fell into coma.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of Ruri, Real Ruri truly fell in love with Real Naomi at the firework festival. That’s why Beta Ruri must also fall in love with Beta Naomi at the firework festival in order to sync Beta Ruri’s mind into Real Ruri’s body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what about Naomi&amp;#39;s case? What was the condition to sync Real Naomi’s mind in Alpha world with his real body in reality? Real Naomi technically fell into coma the moment he dived into Beta world, or after he successfully sync Beta Ruri’s mind. But in either case, the mental state of Real Naomi right before he fell into coma was supposed to be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I want to save Ruri at any cost, even if it means to trick my past self”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But think back the final action he did in the Alpha world before he woke up. Real Naomi sacrificed himself to save Beta Naomi, and bless them (Beta Naomi &amp;amp; Beta Ruri) to stay happy in a world without him. This action most likely was the trigger that bring Real Naomi’s mind back to the reality. So how did this action match with the mental state before Real Naomi fell in coma? It just doesn&amp;#39;t seem to add up to me......&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, keep in mind that both Alpha Ruri and Real Ruri got struck by lightning in this theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the one woke up in reality and dive back into the Beta world 10 years later was actually Beta Ruri’s consciousness&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you remember, Beta Ruri loves Beta Naomi, not the Real Naomi. In her perspective, Beta Naomi and Real Naomi were 2 different people. So even if Beta Ruri learned everything Real Naomi has done for her and wanted to resurrect his real life body, doesn’t it make more sense if she sync Beta Naomi’s mind back into the reality instead?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this other theory from Bilibili brings up a different perspective of thinking. What if the one who got struck by lightning in reality was actually Real Naomi, not Real Ruri to begin with? With this assumption given, here is the chronological order of the entire story:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to save Real Naomi, Real Ruri spent her next 10 years studying and eventually became the ALLTALE administrator. After everything was well prepared, she dived into Alpha world as a crow avatar (some says she dived in as the bookmark, or the cat from Another World. There&amp;#39;s no proof of what avatar she actually dived into Alpha world, but it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter what avatar she was).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her plan was to re-simulate the exact same history event that happened in reality, but change the fact of Alpha Naomi getting struck by lightning at the end, hence she can sync his mind into Real Naomi’s body. In another words, Real Ruri’s plan was exactly the same as Alpha Naomi’s plan as we saw in the first half of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the moment Real Ruri entered Alpha world, the records have already started changing even if Real Ruri didn’t interfere with anything. Although Alpha Naomi was able to repeat the same history, something went wrong and Alpha Ruri got struck by lightning instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you may ask, if Real Naomi was struck by lightning simply because he was unlucky, then Real Ruri should have been able to sync Alpha Naomi&amp;#39;s mind now, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The moment before the accident happened in reality, Real Naomi fell in love with Real Ruri during the firework festival. And the moment before the accident happened in Alpha world, Alpha Naomi also fell in love with Alpha Ruri during the firework festival. The mental state should have been the same for both Alpha and Real Naomi. It should have been the exact same case as what we saw with Beta Ruri earlier in the movie. So why didn’t the sync happen? Perhaps there was something more than just falling in love with Ruri before he went into coma?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if during the accident, Real Ruri was the one supposed to get struck by lightning. However, Real Naomi pushed her off and got hit instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This could explain why Alpha Naomi was not able to sync at this moment, as he didn’t have the sacrificial mentality during the accident. Perhaps Alpha Naomi hesitated? Or maybe he was not decisive enough? In either case, the simulation was a failure and Real Ruri was at a loss, but the story didn’t just stop here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real Ruri watched over Alpha Naomi spent his next 10 years studying, climbed up to become the ALLTALE administrator, and dived into the Beta world trying to resurrect Alpha Ruri, exactly the same way as she (Real Ruri) did in reality. This was where the movie began.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all the events happened in the first half of the movie, Alpha Naomi was able to made Beta Ruri fell in love with Beta Naomi, and sync her mind into Alpha Ruri’s body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real Ruri followed Alpha Naomi into the Beta world and witnessed everything that happened as well. Perhaps she couldn’t stand the tragic fate for Beta Naomi, she decided to help him out. Then, the 2nd half of the movie events happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end, Alpha Naomi finally understand that the one Beta Ruri loved was never him to begin with, but rather Beta Naomi. For Beta Ruri’s sake, he pushed Beta Naomi off from the spike attack, sacrificing his life for their happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In reality, Real Naomi pushed Real Ruri off from the lightning, sacrificing his life for Ruri’s life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of this sacrificial mentality for the girl that he loved, Alpha Naomi was finally able to sync 100% into Real Naomi body and wake up in the reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while this is a story of a guy who dedicated his entire life trying to save a girl that he loved, it is also a story of a girl who didn’t even know how to use a cell phone to begin with, studied her way up to become the top administrator of the ALLTALE research facility; A story of a girl who had Acrophobia was willing to go up to the moon base, all for the sake of saving a guy that she loved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the end, Real Ruri&amp;#39;s goal was accomplished as she successfully resurrected Naomi’s body in reality, though her original plan of re-stimulating Alpha Naomi to save Alpha Ruri from the lightning was a failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this theory, the question I had earlier can now be explained. Ruri’s consciousness in reality was never Beta version, but her own real version to begin with. This is why she wanted to salvage the Alpha version of Naomi’s mind, not the Beta version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But wait, there is still one question remain. Why would Real Ruri (crow) want to help Alpha Naomi to resurrect Alpha Ruri’s body by diving into the Beta world? Isn&amp;#39;t she afraid that Alpha Naomi would succeed and end up living with Alpha Ruri in the Alpha world forever, causing Real Naomi to never wake up?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer is, Yes. Of course she didn’t want this outcome to happen. But what she couldn’t stand the most was seeing him sad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in the Alpha world, she had witnessed a guy who failed to save his beloved one on the firework festival, and dedicated his life to save her. This is why she decided to help Alpha Naomi with his plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the Beta world, she had witnessed a guy who gave his everything for the girl he loved, even until the world collapsed. This is why she decided to help Beta Naomi for his happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this also reflect the theme of the movie...... Even if the world was about to break down, I want to see you once again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, let us take a close look at a detail scene near the end of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zcw4gh7nbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fedbd83ba87c90c6d6676a3fe943f967eb79f69d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/zcw4gh7nbke71.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fedbd83ba87c90c6d6676a3fe943f967eb79f69d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bookmark turned into a golden feather in Ruri’s pocket. What is the meaning behind this particular scene?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before we answer this question, let’s rewind a bit to see what happened a moment ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/ov8n5t/video/byt9haxpbke71/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/ov8n5t/video/byt9haxpbke71/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you notice something feels off here? At this moment, Beta Ruri’s mind was inside Alpha Ruri’s body. Beta Ruri should have no idea how much Alpha Naomi loves her, nor how much had Alpha Naomi done for her sake in the past 10 years. In her eyes, this man should just be a stranger who simply looks like Naomi. Then how come Beta Ruri said such a line to him?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if we combine the next close-up scene where the bookmark turned into a golden feather, perhaps we can make a wild guess here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if the consciousness inside Alpha Ruri’s body at this moment was not only Beta Ruri’s, but also the Real Ruri’s as well? Then everything starts to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real Ruri’s consciousness temporary entered Alpha Ruri’s body through the crow’s power at this moment. Because Real Ruri was the one stayed by Alpha Naomi’s side in the past 10 years, and she had witnessed everything happened to Alpha Naomi. That’s why she knew exactly what he have done and how much he love Ruri.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In reality, the accident happened right after the two of them just started dating. Although Real Naomi saved her life, she couldn’t really confirm how much he loved her. I mean, he could be a guy who is willing to save anyone, just like any main protagonist in anime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what she saw in the Alpha world was an alternative history where Naomi would have done the exact same thing for her sake if she was the one fell in coma instead. You can even say that Real Ruri understands Alpha Naomi better than anyone else on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so at this moment, a real soul, a simulated soul, and a simulated body, three versions of Ruri sync together right before Alpha Naomi, and say out such an intriguing line. Behind these words bury a deep love from a world far away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, I just want to say that this is a movie with an open ending. There is no absolute right or wrong theory. What it really matter is which theory you believe in the most, and that is the true ending of yours&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video version of this
