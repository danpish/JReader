A Reddit frontend I made as a hobby that uses Teddit.
# installation
For Windows, download the Ruby installer with devkit from [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)

If you are using Linux, download Ruby with your package manager. Make sure you have Build Essentials or something similar installed as well.

Once you have Ruby installed, install Gosu and reverse_markdown with Gem.
```
gem install gosu
gem install "reverse_markdown"
```
or you can install dependencies with bundle.
```
bundle install
```

Once Gosu is installed, clone this repo or download and extract the src zip file anywhere you like. Then run Jreader with:
```
ruby main.rb
```
